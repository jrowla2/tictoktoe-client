# Tic Tac Toe!

## Introduction

This is a game of tic tac toe between two players where you must be logged in to play.

## How To Play

First player to get 3 in a row wins!
If no player gets 3 in a row, game is a tie.

To start the game, first create an account by signing-up, then sign-in. Once signed-in, the new game board will appear. X goes first followed by O.

You can restart at any time during the game. 

Your password can be changed below the game board once logged in.

** Please be aware that this is a game with simulated authorization for user sign-up and sign-in. Do not use real email and password as that data is not secure. **
